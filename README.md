# Cam_Tools
Cam Tools is a streamlined camera toolkit designed to speed up scene framing, composition, and per-camera render settings. Add cameras directly from the viewport view, switch and manage multiple cameras efficiently, and apply unique resolution overrides per camera without touching global render settings.
